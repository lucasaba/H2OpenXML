# H2OXML : HTML to OpenXML Converter
Simple PHP script which take HTML code and transform it into OpenXML Code. (for Docx)

This is the very first version. I coded this because i wanted to put text from a WYSIWYG editor into a .docx document.

## WHAT H2OXML CAN DO
For now it can deals with :

Bold, italic and underlined text
Bulleted lists ... Many more can be done (the wysiwyg editor had only simple functions)

## HOW TO USE IT
Load the script .../HTMLtoOpenXML.php';

Then if your html code is in the variable $html, use this function:

HTMLtoOpenXML::getInstance()->fromHTML($article)

You will obtain a string formated in OpenXML.
